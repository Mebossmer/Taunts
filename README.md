# Taunts

Play sounds when typing numbers into chat

### Configuration

    # taunts.cfg

    general {
        # list of sound events (beginning at index 1)
        S:taunts <
            # add sound events here
            # e.g.

            minecraft:block.anvil.place # taunt #1
            minecraft:block.dispenser.dispense # taunt #2
        >
    }

You can also add custom taunts by adding your own sound events using resource packs.
